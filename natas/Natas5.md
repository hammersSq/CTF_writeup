The challenge homepage says:
"Access disallowed. You are not logged in"

Since i had burp suite opened from previous challenge as a first thing i checked the http request with the proxy:
``` http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM1OjBuMzVQa2dnQVBtMnpiRXBPVTgwMmMweDBNc24xVG9L

```
As we can se there is a cookie to see if we are logged in

trying to set it to 1:
```http
... 
Cookie: loggedin=1
...
```
and forward the modified request.

With the modified request the site answer with the password:
*Access granted. The password for natas6 is 0RoJwHdSKWFTYR5WuiAewauSuNaBXned*\
