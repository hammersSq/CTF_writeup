# find password for kay

in /home/kay/.ssh there is the private key to be used to log in in ssh with kay user:

***ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.218.209***

this key is protected by a passphrase, so we can crack it with john the ripper:

(key_id_rsa is a copy of ssh key)


***/opt/john/ssh2john.py kay_id_rsa > forJohn.txt***

this will put the key in a format that john the ripper can understand


now we can crack the pass with john using rockyou wordlist:

***/opt/john/john forJohn.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt***

once we logged in with the kay user we can read the pass.bat file to get the kay's password and finish the room.
